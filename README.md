# so-journey
All code, experience while answering (or trying to) Stack Overflow questions. It is a journey. This repository is a journal.

This is October, 2019

## Focus
Everything possible in the .NET ecosystem, especially:

1. C#
1. .NET Core, AspNet Core

I also started to look into Python. So I might have a chance to answer some questions.

## Structure
Each Q&A is a folder grouping by year. This will help me visualizing how many questions I have contributed so far.
